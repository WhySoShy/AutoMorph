## AutoMorph

AutoMorph is a .NET Source Generator that simplifies object mapping by generating code based on attributes attached to your classes, structs, and records.

### Key Features
* <strong>Compile-Time Execution</strong>: AutoMorph runs during compilation, reducing the need for runtime mapping logic and minimizing its impact on performance.
* <strong>Readable Generated Code</strong>: All generated mappings are saved to separate, easily accessible files, allowing you to review and validate the methods as needed.
* <strong>Attribute-Based Design</strong>: By adding attributes to your types, you can customize how mappings are generated without extensive manual setup.

AutoMorph is designed to reduce repetitive boilerplate and streamline your development workflow.

## Why?
<p>I began the project beacuse i wanted to make it easier and faster to create extension methods that can map objects.</p>
<p>I had already made a generator 2 times before, with the same purpose but never went far with it, each with the use of and IndentedTextWriter.</p>
